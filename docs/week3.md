# Week 3: Data Pre-processing, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis

*Nov 6 - Nov 12*

Based on EdX [FA18: Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computing-for-data-analysis)

This course is your hands-on introduction to programming techniques relevant to data analysis and
machine learning. Most of the programming exercises will be based on Python and SQL.
